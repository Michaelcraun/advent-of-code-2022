A simple module for working with local paths.

Methods
-------
project_path(to_dir: str, filename: str = None, create: bool = True) -> str
    Creates a path to the designated directory in the project's root.

system_path(to_dir: str, filename: str = None) -> str
    Creates a path to the designated directory on the disk.

is_file(directory: str) -> bool
    Determines if the object located at a specific directory is a file or not.

    Deletes an entire directory, if possible. Alternatively, you can remove a

    Warning
    -------
    This method is designed to be very unforgiving. Only use this if you are
    **absolutely** certain you no longer need the supplied directory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    project_directory: str | None
        The path relative to the project you wish to remove.
    system_directory: str | None
        The path relative to the system you wish to remove.
